SSR(Server Side Rendering)
 In website terms:
When you open a web page, the server prepares everything (the full page) and sends it to your browser, already ready to display.

For example :
        Imagine you're hungry and order a pizza from your favorite restaurant.
The restaurant bakes the pizza completely, packs it, and delivers it to your home.
You just open the box and eat — quick and easy!
Used in:
   Next.js (React framework that supports SSR)
   WordPress
   News websites, blogs, and e-commerce homepages


CSR(Client Side Rendering)   
    In website terms:
When you visit the site, the server sends a mostly empty page with just the instructions (JavaScript).
Your browser (like your kitchen) builds the whole page using those instructions.

For example:
       Imagine you order a pizza, but instead of a hot, ready-made one, you get a DIY pizza kit — dough, sauce, cheese, toppings.
Now you have to assemble and bake it at home before you can eat.
Used in:
     React
     Vue
     Angular
     Most modern web apps and dashboards


SPA (Single Page Application)
     The website loads once when you open it.
     After that, when you click on stuff (like buttons or links), only parts of the page change.
     It feels super fast, and you don't see the whole screen flashing or reloading.

For example:
     In Gmail, when you open an email, the inbox stays there, and only the message area changes.
It’s quick, smooth, and the page never fully reloads.

SQL: 
     SQL is Structured Query Language and it is best for the sturctured data
     Storing customer records (name, age, orders).
     Structure: Tables (rows & columns)	
     Example DB: MySQL, PostgreSQL

NoSQL: 
     NoSQL is Not Only SQL and it is best for the unstructured data
     Storing chat messages, social media posts.
     Structure: Flexible (JSON, key-value, etc.)
     Example DB: MongoDB, Firebase, CouchDB


HISTORY OF API:
     It lets your website change the URL in the browser
     like going from /home to /profile
     Without reloading the whole website
