What is Docker?

Docker is a platform to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers. It allows apps to be isolated from infrastructure.

Docker Components:
- Docker Engine: Core service that runs containers
- Docker Images: Blueprints for containers
- Docker Containers: Running instances of Docker images
- Docker Hub: Public repo for images
- Dockerfile: Script that defines the image
- Docker Compose: Tool to run multi-container apps using YAML

Pros:
- Consistent environments (dev â†’ prod)
- Lightweight and fast
- Easy to scale
- Reduces setup time

Cons:
- Steep learning curve for beginners
- GUI support is limited
- Networking can get complex



Dockerfile:
- Used to build a Docker image
- Contains commands like `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `CMD`

Docker Compose:
- Used to manage multi-container applications
- Uses YAML file (docker-compose.yml)
- Commands:
  - `docker-compose up` (start containers)
  - `docker-compose down` (stop & remove)
