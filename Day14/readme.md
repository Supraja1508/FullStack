                                   UNDERSTANDING OF LIBRARY VS FRAMEWORKS

LIBRARY:
       
       A library is a collection of tools or functions you can call and use in your code whenever you need.
       You are in control and decide when and how to use it.
       You use the tools you want, when you want.

Example: jQuery(Simplifies JavaScript and DOM tasks), React(Building user interfaces (UI))

FRAMEWORK:
         
         A framework is a ready-made structure that gives you a set of rules and flow to build your project.
         It controls your code and tells you where to write what.

Example: Angular(Full front-end web app framework), Django(Web development in Python)
