In day 2 creating Resume using the HTML & CSS

HTML FILE 

This HTML file is a structured resume for me, a fresher in Computer Science Engineering. It includes key sections like technical skills, strengths, languages, education, internships, and a major project. The layout uses semantic elements like tables, lists, and headings for clear presentation. A video section is also added for visual support. It links to an external CSS file for styling.

CSS FILE

This CSS file styles the HTML resume with a clean and professional layout. It includes custom class-based styles for sections like technical skills, strengths, and internships. Background colors, padding, text formatting, and borders are used to visually organize content. The design ensures readability, neat alignment, and modern presentation across all sections.
