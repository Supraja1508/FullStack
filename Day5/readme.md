 Absolute Position Demo

This project demonstrates how to use the position: absolute and relative properties in HTML and CSS. It includes a centered layout with a fixed bottom app bar and a floating action button (FAB) using absolute positioning. The heading is also positioned absolutely for precise layout control. It's a simple and effective example for beginners learning how CSS positioning works in web design.

 Fixed Position Example

This project illustrates the use of position: fixed in CSS, showcasing a floating action button (+) that stays in place even when other elements scroll or move. Itâ€™s wrapped inside a mobile-like tab UI for a clean, centered look. This is perfect for beginners exploring fixed elements like sticky buttons or headers in responsive designs.

Sticky Position Example

This project demonstrates how to use position: sticky in CSS with a navigation bar and a circular element that stay fixed within scrollable content. The sticky nav bar remains at the top, while the round button sticks once it reaches the top offset. It's a great example to understand how sticky positioning behaves between static and fixed elements in a scrolling layout. Perfect for learning smooth UI effects in modern web design
