This is day6 creating a display file 

This HTML and CSS project showcases various layout techniques and display properties. It includes demonstrations of viewport units (`vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, `vmax`) and different `display` types like block, inline, inline-block, and none. Flexbox layouts are used to illustrate alignment using `justify-content` and `align-items`. CSS Grid is applied to manage complex layouts with column and row spanning. Each section is styled with distinct colors for clarity and learning purposes. This project helps understand responsive design and layout behavior in CSS.
